## Description

aOHS is a configurable zone based OHS violation detecting and warning system. Using computer vision, it detects violations in real time and notifies the relevant authority and the worker who is violating the rules in real time. By automating the occupational health and safety rules, it aims to reduce industrial accidents.

With its features like processing multiple cameras and having a particular configuration for each of these cameras, it lets companies fully secure their workplaces. With its integrable architecture it allows companies to add new machine learning models depending on their needs. 

It also keeps records of the violations and this way, OHS specialists can see past violations for each worker and they can retrieve violation-time graphs, which is configurable depending on specialists needs, using aOHS system.
